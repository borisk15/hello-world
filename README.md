This is the Hello World Repository from the Github Tutorial

My name is Boris Kouambo. I am new to Github, and keen to start using it for all my coding projects and to build my portfolio. 

I hold a Bachelors degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Cape Town, and have a keen interest in data science and its applications to business. I'm quite business-minded, with an entrepreneurial spirit. 

Looking forward to collaborating with you all!

Boris
